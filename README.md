This repo is intended for research and discovery purposes, it does not offer a functioning mod but rather a fragmented proof of concept I haven't touched in months.

This is a DV mod that allows a camera to be created in a Unity game and piped out to a stream visible in software like OBS (This is literally the only current test/use case I have)

This repo also includes garbage I've forgotten about, which may or may not be required for compiling.
